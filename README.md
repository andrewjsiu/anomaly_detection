# Anomaly Detection

This repository includes my code in Python to implement the feature of detecting a significantly large purchase compared to previous  purchases made by one's social network. The purpose is to help the e-commerce company flag up these large purchases for their friends to see, hoping they will be influenced to make similar purchases.
